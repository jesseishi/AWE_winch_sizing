Airborne wind energy is an emerging technology that aims to capture the stronger and more steady higher altitude winds using tethered kites. The size of the winch, defined by its inertia and radius, has an important effect on the dynamics of the overall system for ground-generation concepts. This repository contains some code to analyse these dynamics using a linearized simplified model of a ground-generation airborne wind energy system.
